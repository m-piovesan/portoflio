  This diversity of projects provided me with valuable experience and allowed me to grow significantly as a developer, not to mention the exposure to many technologies, such as Next, Typescript, Svelte, React Native, among others.

bellosoftTitle: "Junior Front-End Developer - Bellosoft"
bellosoftDesc: |
  for several months, I was part of the Bellosoft development team, where I contributed to multiple projects across different areas, significantly developing my skills and contributing with my professional experience. This was my first formal contact with the software development world, making it an extremely enriching experience.

  the main stacks involved Vue and its ecosystem, using TypeScript and SASS with the BEM methodology for style organization. These tools were key in my contributions to projects related to dog adoption, sales of homemade and organic food, business metrics dashboards, among others.
icsTitle: Scientific Initiation Projects
icsDesc: |
  I have been a member of several scientific initiation and extension projects at UFPR. The first one was Ciência nas Escolas, in which an application was developed to support education in elementary schools in the state of Paraná. In this project, I worked as an active developer on both the front-end and back-end teams, using technologies and concepts such as React, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and the SCRUM methodology.

  I also participated in the maintenance of the DezMente Cognitive App project, where I was responsible for helping to develop and maintain an application aimed at supporting the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment in older adults, using the well-established Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as a reference.

  finally, I was part of the extension project Ciência para Todos, where I was primarily responsible for developing web pages according to specific requirements, as well as assisting in the management of the technology department.
unitedTitle: my period as an English Teacher
unitedDesc: |
  for nearly one year, I worked as a language teacher, guiding dozens of students from their first contact with the English language until achieving full fluency. I stood out from the very beginning by conceptualizing and executing a new project at the school, bringing back former students and attracting new ones, increasing engagement and customer retention. In addition, I also worked as the school's designer and social media manager.

  this period added significant value to my life, as it not only reinforced my fluency in the language but also greatly sharpened my soft skills, since I taught students of various age groups, different levels of language proficiency, and even some international students, working remotely when necessary. I have some very good memories from this time and still keep contact with some students.

ifcTitle: IFC
ifcDesc: I think it’s worth sharing a bit about my high school years. I studied full-time at IFC (Instituto Federal Catarinense), Videira campus, a federal technical school where I had my first deeper contact with computer science, since I took the IT technical course. It was an awesome time; unfortunately, part of it happened during the pandemic, but especially the last year was really great. Shout-out to professor Manfe, who taught us basic HTML and CSS… look where that took me today lol;

curitibaTitle: 'moved to Curitiba'
curitibaDesc: 'we left Videira early, me, my parents and my brother, the trip took about 5 hours in total. Videira and Curitiba are about 330km apart so it’s a fairly tiring trip, but obviously I was very excited, we had already seen and rented the apartment some time before, so basically I packed my clothes, computer and stuff and that was it;'

gesDesc: more recently, I joined the development team at G&S Agro Informática, working in a full-stack role, with a stronger focus on the front-end. The scope here involves agricultural software and systems, serving companies on a national scale.

  I really enjoy trap music and I also like sharing my opinions about things lol. That said, by clicking on the image you’ll open my Musicboard profile, which is basically a Letterboxd for music. So if you’re curious about what I’ve been listening to lately, it’s all there (by the way, my Letterboxd is jovempio).
